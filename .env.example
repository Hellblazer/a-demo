# CRITICAL #1 RESOLUTION: Database Password Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# This environment variable controls the database password used during Maven
# build-time configuration ONLY. It is NOT used at runtime.
#
# Used by Maven plugins during build:
# - liquibase-maven-plugin: Schema initialization (H2 in-memory database)
# - jooq-codegen-maven: Code generation from database schema
#
# IMPORTANT: This password is only needed during build. The final Docker image
# does not contain this password - it's only used for temporary schema setup.
#
# Usage:
# 1. For local development: Leave unset or use "test-default"
# 2. For production CI/CD: Set via secrets management (GitHub Secrets, etc.)
# 3. For Docker builds: Pass via --build-arg: docker build --build-arg DB_PASSWORD=value

# Default: test-default (for development)
# For production: Use a strong, random password (e.g., 32+ random characters)
# Example strong password: $(openssl rand -base64 32)

export DB_PASSWORD=test-default

# =============================================================================
# Future: Runtime Configuration (Phase 2+)
# =============================================================================
#
# The following variables will be used at runtime in Phase 2 and beyond:
# - VAULT_ADDR: HashiCorp Vault server address
# - VAULT_TOKEN: Vault authentication token
# - LOG_LEVEL: Application log level
# - METRICS_PORT: Prometheus metrics endpoint port
#
# These are not yet implemented in Phase 1
